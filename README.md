| Project Link | Summary | Skills and Tools |    
|---|---|---|
|üó∫Ô∏è [Visa Approval Facilitation](https://github.com/sarahortega-hub/sarahortega-hub/blob/main/EasyVisa%20.ipynb) |  This project involves developing machine learning models to predict visa approval outcomes for the OFLC. By analyzing applicant data and identifying key influencing factors, we aim to streamline the visa approval process, optimize resource allocation, and improve decision-making accuracy. The ML models will provide valuable insights into applicant profiles, enabling OFLC to prioritize cases and make informed recommendations for visa certification or denial. | `Ensemble Techniques and Model Tuning` `Exploratory Data Analysis` `Ensemble Techniques` `Bagging` `Boosting` `Data Pre-processing`  `Model Tuning` `Sampling` `Hyperparameter tuning`|   
|üè¢[INN Hotels](https://github.com/sarahortega-hub/sarahortega-hub/blob/main/INNHotels%20.ipynb)|Analyze the data of INN Hotels to find which factors have a high influence on booking cancellations, build a predictive model that can predict which booking is going to be canceled in advance, and help in formulating profitable policies for cancellations and refunds.|`Supervised Learning` `EDA` `Data Preprocessing` `Logistic Regression` `Multicollinearity` `AUC-ROC Curve` `Decision Tree` `Pruning`|
|üì≥ ReCell|Analyze the used devices dataset, build a model which will help develop a dynamic pricing strategy for used and refurbished devices, and identify factors that significantly influence the price.|`Supervised Learning` `EDA` `Linear Regression` `Linear Regression assumptions` `Business insights and recommendations`|
|üì∞E-news Express Project|This project used statistical analysis, a/b testing, and visualization to decide whether the new landing page of an online news portal (E-news Express) is effective enough to gather new subscribers or not. The simulated dataset has certain important metrics such as converted status and time spent on the page that will help to conclude the effectiveness of the new landing page. Apart from that, the dependence of conversion on the preferred language will also be analyzed in this project.|`Business Statistics` `Hypothesis Testing` `a/b testing` `Data Visualization` `Statistical Inference`|
